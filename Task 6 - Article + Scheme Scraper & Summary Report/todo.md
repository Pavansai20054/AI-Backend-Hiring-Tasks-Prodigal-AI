# 🕸️ Article + Scheme Scraper & Summary Report

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

**Scrape and summarize content from both dynamic (JS-heavy) and static web sources, demonstrating resilient scraping strategies and robust reporting.**

---

## 🛠️ **Targets**

- 📚 **Microsoft Research Blog https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/**
- 🗂️ **MyScheme Portal https://www.myscheme.gov.in/search**

---

## 🗃️ **Tasks Overview**

- 🔗 **Extract all article/scheme titles, links, and descriptions**
- 🌀 **Handle pagination or "load more" (dynamic content)**
- 📦 **Store results** in structured format (JSON/CSV/DB)
- 📊 **Generate a summary report**:
  - Page structure & scraping challenges
  - Anti-bot or CAPTCHA mechanisms
  - Completeness of scraped data

---

## 🌈 **Main Things To Do (Highlights)**

---

### 1. **Scraper Development**

- Use **Playwright** (for dynamic pages) & **Scrapy** (for static pages).
- Parse and extract:
  - Title
  - Link
  - Description/summary
- Handle navigation, "load more", or multi-page scraping.

---

### 2. **Data Export**

- Save extracted data to **JSON**, **CSV**, or a simple **DB**.
- Ensure data is structured and labeled.

---

### 3. **Summary Report**

- Analyze and document:
  - **Page structure challenges**
  - **Anti-bot detection or CAPTCHA** (if encountered)
  - **Data completeness** (missed items, consistency, etc.)
- Present findings clearly in markdown or PDF.

---

### 4. **Demo & Documentation**

- Provide:
  - Scraper codebase (Python)
  - Exported dataset (JSON/CSV/DB)
  - Summary report (with screenshots if needed)
  - Short demo video
